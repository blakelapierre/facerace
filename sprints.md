    Developers:

        [good enough] Commit -> play on dev-test server

            x commit -> push to github (run hooks.sh ... is there a way to make this executable by default?)
            
            [good enough] push to github -> deploy to dev-test server (http://107.170.237.209:3006)
                
                [~] watchmen project to watch for github events (https://github.com/blakelapierre/watchmen)
                
                    [~] experiment some more with this...it should be much more powerful
                    
                        very powerful now (commit -> new deployment and/or update existing deployment), can be exponentially more powerful in the future
                
            x game should be more than a black screen that wants access to your mic
