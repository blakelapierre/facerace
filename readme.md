Where we are: Face Race
=======================


3D realtime multiplayer cart-racing game where you race your face *in the browser* or *on your phone* against the other faces on the Internet (or at least in your current race)


    git clone https://github.com/BlakeLaPierre/facerace.git

    cd facerace
    
    git checkout rewrite

    npm install

    bower install


Then play:

    grunt default (to start server and launch Chrome (Win only (I think) right now, sorry))

or

    grunt startServer (to just start the server)


Todo: 


Get master running -> continuous integration -> dev play-test server



Extremely likely to be Android/Chrome only right now.
