Don't worry about this yet (unless you have an opinion), it's reference material for me. I'm going to work on the business aspects of this for a bit and let Rob focus on the core simulation and experience. These are mostly orthogonal concerns so I think it makes sense to split it up like this.

I still need to do more investigation, but I don't see anything blocking the current (proposed) setup (node simulation servers, and node admin/whatever servers). We also want to be as open as possible to integrating with others, so let's not tie ourselves to closely to zuck.
