* Communication is fucked up somewhere, I think the client sim isn't getting the new players (not intentional; somewhere in the git history is a working multiplayer version (although I think it stutters occasionally))

* Actual racing...all you can do right now is drive/float around

* Items...boosts...teleports...launchers...shrinkers...traps...anything cool

* Sound recording (very, very early code in) - to be played during the game in response to various events (item uses, etc.)

* When a player brings in a persistent item or effect, everyone in that game benefits (maybe, we have an item that is associated with a certain set of powerups, and those powerups only appear in the game if someone is using that item)

* Probably will want to support world-wide (but also regional/localized...we still have the speed of light (presumably) to deal with) match making, right now you run your own setup -- rooms? lobbies? skill/interest-based matching?

* Racers get some quantity for racing and/or their performance, this quantity can be divided and traded to obtain persistent items or traded among the racers
