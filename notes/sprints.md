                Blake,

                We aren't ready for a stand-up yet. Planning first. 10:00 Pacific sounds
                perfect.

                Google HangOut tomorrow at 10. We will be defining the sprint, writing some
                quick user stories and building what is known as the product backlog
                (collection of stories).

                You will prioritize them.

                We get through what we can each sprint agreed up-front. I commit to a level
                of work in the sprint, we define completeness criteria and off we go.
                Sprint length will be determined in planning tomorrow.

                -Rob

                During a sprint, new stories continue to go on the backlog, and you keep it
                stack ranked for priority
