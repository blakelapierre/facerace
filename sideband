why not?

don't forget to 'npm install' your dependencies first

and set the correct permissions

"done without errors.", at least that's what I think it said. I was expecting something else. let's see if it starts up.

interesting off-by-1 error with updates to the Gruntfile.js. Probably an easy fix, will look at late (hopefully). The problem is that it's still running the old grunt file even though you really want it to be running the fresh Gruntfile.js after the pull.

last watchmen test seemed good enough, let's try this one again

^^^^sideband is editable. good thing or we might have confused it with the last message. this test will take at least two commits...standby

expected that. now let's try the second one.

probably helps to restart watchmen after you push an update...shouldn't it update itself?

need some rest, the answers are right there and very simple, just don't have theclarity right now to manifest them. will try again in the morning...it *does* run however :)

dinner with kim's parents, [SURVIVOR](http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor), and probably a game of [innovation+expansions](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6388/innovation). i'll be back later tonight

somewhere between sfo1.nlayer.net and wherever digital ocean's sfo servers are, my packets are experiencing massive loss...pos...how am I supposed to work like this (committing from dev-test server over ssh)

routes are back up apparently. testing watchmen insta-deploy now
